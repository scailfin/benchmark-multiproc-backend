About
=====

This repository contains the implementation of a simple workflow engine that is capable to execute `parameterized workflow specifications <https://github.com/scailfin/benchmark-templates>`_ for the *Reproducible Open Benchmarks for Data Analysis Platform (ROB)*.

**Note**: This repository is discontinued. It has been replaced by the core package for the `Reproducible Open Benchmarks for Data Analysis Platform (ROB) <https://github.com/scailfin/rob-core>`_.

The workflow engine runs each workflow step as a subprocess in Python.

**DISCLAIMER**: This engine is primarily intended for testing purposes. It is not recommended to be used as the workflow engine in production systems.
